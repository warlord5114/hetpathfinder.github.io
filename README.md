# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer — hetpathfinder.github.io

Welcome to **hetpathfinder.github.io**, a web-based interactive **pathfinding algorithm visualizer**. This project allows you to explore how different algorithms like BFS and DFS find the shortest path between two points in a grid — all in real time and with animations!

🚀 **Live Demo**: [Click here to try it out!](https://warlord5114.github.io/hetpathfinder.github.io)

## 🎯 Features

- **Grid-based visual interface**
- **Drag to add/remove walls**
- Visualizes classic algorithms like:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- Animated path discovery in real time
- Reset and re-run on the same grid

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🖥️ HTML
- 🎨 CSS
- 🧠 JavaScript (Vanilla)

No frameworks used — lightweight and fast!

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Click and drag to create **walls** (untraversable cells).
2. Press **Start** to visualize the selected algorithm.
3. See the nodes visited and the final path highlighted.
4. Click **Reset** to clear and explore again.

## 🏗️ Future Improvements (Optional)

- Add more algorithms (A*, Dijkstra)
- Weighted grid options
- Mobile responsiveness
- Speed controls and step-by-step debugging
